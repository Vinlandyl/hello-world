# hello-world
My own personal website that is also a portfolio

I discovered GitHub through a soccer team mate after I told him I wanted to make my own website.

I intend to use my  website as a portfolio that will hopefully help me get a job in software development since I'm more than bored with my current job.

Step one was getting my own domain.
Step two is making a GitHub account.

Step four is profit?
